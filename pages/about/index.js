              Due to the pandemic, I have been working from home for more than
              75% of the time. What a learning experience this has been for me.
              Communicating and working with your colleagues productively is key
              for every successful team. The pandemic has surely taught me that.
              Thankfully, I have a great team who all got along. I still feel a
              bit salty towards those people who have never responded to my
              email or left me on read on the Teams app üòÇ. Please visit my{" "}

              I graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a
              degree in Computer Science. My college experience was a very
              important part in my personal and technical development. This was
              the first time I would ever be living alone, so that meant I had
              to take care of the things that my beautiful parents ‚ù§Ô∏è used to
              take care of. I also learned how to manage my time efficiently and
              effectively.

              I no longer had someone telling me what to do anymore. That kind
              of freedom could either benefit or harm someone. Thankfully, my
              parents have instilled within me a strong internal locus of
              control. I understood that my output was directly related to my
              input. My knowledge was simply a reflection of the effectiveness
              of my preparation. I write more about my college experience in my
              blog. I write about school, living alone, managing my social life
              and my studies, and much more. Please visit my{" "}
