Welcome to my blog. I hope my articles are of great benefit for anyone who may be reading. Even if no one is reading my blog, I will still enjoy the process of writing them. I realized that I really enjoy writing. It is not about the attention I may receive, even though it would be nice to have people reading my blog posts, but it is about being able to express my thoughts/opinions in a way which I am comfortable doing.

I am quite a shy person, so I am not too outgoing on social media. I have other reasons why I do not really use social media, but I will save that for another post (did I get you hooked yet?). However, I do see the benefits of these social platforms when used properly, hence why I have recently created a <a blue outerLink href="https://twitter.com/sulaimanhamouda">Twitter</a> account. I want to be able to reach out to a larger audience and drive traffic to my blog in order to attract more readers. I intend on writing about different topics, such as technology, experiences from work and school, advice for students, and much more. I truly hope that my writing is of a benefit for at least someone out there.

## A little about me.

<hr />
My name is Sulaiman Hamouda. I am a Software Engineer. I graduated from the University
of Central Florida (UCF) with a B.S. in Computer Science, in December of 2019. Even
though I graduated, I never got off the path of learning. Being consistent in our
learning helps us form new ideas and discover more things about life. It is the moment
when we stop learning that our brain starts to lockdown and deteriorate.

  “Doors hold the entry to unlimited imagination. Before you open any door, a
  world filled with possibilities sits right behind it. It isn’t until you open
  it, they are realized. Such potential they bring to our minds. Yet, a lock
  stops us from all that. How... lazy.” - Mr. Robot

### Experience

Most of my experience in tech is within frontend development. I use technologies such as React.js, Next.js, and more. I also have experience developing backend services in Java and Node. At the time of writing this post, I am working at NextEra Energy as a Software Engineer. I am working on an application which is meant for helping customers monitor their energy usage and simulate future cases. This will help customers be more aware of their consumption of energy and potentially save money.

### Interests

Apart from my interests in tech, I am also interested in literature, languages, teaching, and much more. I have recently picked up an interest in Psychology. The human mind is a complex thing which most of us do not even understand or are even able to control. Thus, being susceptible to manipulation by companies, people, or beliefs. You will find a lot of companies who have invested in this field in order for them to make their platforms addicting and get their users hooked or manipulating them into buying their products. This introduces a very dangerous effect on us, especially on the youth. Social media has its benefits when utilized properly... but then we are presented with another problem. These companies collect a lot of our private data.

  just a little, into a well-trained dog, or something less pleasant, like a lab
  rat or robot. That you're being remote-controlled, just a little, by clients
  of big corporations."

## Things I will write about.

<hr />I plan on writing a lot about technology, advise for students, and my
experiences from work and school.{" "}

### Tech Tutorials

I will write in depth tutorials on:

<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>and more</li>
</ul>

### Advise for Students

Going off to college is a big step, especially when you are leaving your family to live alone. I have learned a lot of valuable lessons while in college. This is a time where I had a lot of freedom. This freedom could have benefitted me or it could have been a big hurdle. It was my responsibility to dictate my schedule and to handle the tasks which I did not really have to focus on before college. I would love to share my experiences and the lessons which I have learned with those who are in or about to enter college.

### Work Experience

At the time of writing this post, I have been working for exactly one year. There are things which I wish I could do differently and things I would like to improve and focus on. I wish I had read someone elses experiences before starting my journey, in order to learn from their mistakes. So, I would love to share those experiences to help anyone just starting off in their career.
