Firebase is a great tool to use to get something up and running quickly. It provides tools for developers to allow them to build backend services. It is a popular option, especially among frontend developers. Simply connect it to your frontend code and you are ready to start developing.

I will be using Firebase for a lot of cool tutorials. I will be implementing authentication, firestore, cloud functions, and much more. Thus, I am writing this for those who are unfamiliar with how to configure Firebase.

## Setting up Firebase

Before we can get started, you have to set up an account with Google and head over to <LinkOuter href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</LinkOuter>. After you have done that, click on "Create a Project"

/>

Now, you have to give a name for your project and then press "Continue".

  alt='Firebase Name your Project Image'
/>

Accept all of the default choices which Firebase selects for you and accept all of the conditions.

After you have completed setting everything up, you should see the main screen for the project you created. Now, click on the <codesnippet>`</>`</codesnippet>.

Now, we have to add firebase to our app. Add your web app name and continue.

Now, you will be provided with some firebase configurations which we will be using in other tutorials.

There you go. Now you are ready to start using Firebase. You can read my other posts to get a better understand of some of the services which Firebase provides.
